### Bugs ⚠️

One of the free APIs (for plane tickets) we used is *sometimes* unreliable, but you can expect results from the other APIs (hotels, travel sites). There may also be a bug on the server side with user sign-in since the PHP was hastily written. I have yet to fix the code (my apologies!), but sign/log in is not necessary to play with the website's main functionality (screenshots below).
